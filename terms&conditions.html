            Although user data is encrypted and treated confidentially, FindMyValentine reserves the right to access, review, or 
            disclose certain information when necessary to investigate misconduct, policy violations, suspicious behavior, fraud, 
            harassment, or illegal activity. In such cases, we may modify, restrict, or permanently delete content or accounts from 
            our servers to maintain the safety and integrity of the platform and its community.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Reporting and Moderation</h2>
        <p>
            We encourage users to report inappropriate behavior or suspicious profiles. Our moderation team may review accounts,

            is required by law.
